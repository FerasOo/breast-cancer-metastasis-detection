# 🔬 Breast Cancer Metastasis Detection and Ratio Prediction using Deep Learning

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the implementation for Assignment 3 of the AIN2001 course, which consists of two parts, each modeled after a Kaggle competition:

1. **Part 1: Classification Task**
2. **Part 2: Regression Task**

Both parts utilize the same dataset and aim to solve different machine learning problems.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`
  - `train.csv`: Training data with labels for classification and regression tasks.
  - `test.csv`: Testing data without labels.
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Example submission file.
  - `images/`: Directory containing all image files used in the tasks.

## 📝 Assignment Details

### 🔍 Part 1: Classification Task

**Aim:**  
Design deep learning models to detect breast cancer metastases in underarm lymph nodes.

**Objective:**  
Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: "normal" (0) and "cancer" (1). The performance is evaluated using the AUROC metric.

**Dataset:**  
Consisting of images cropped from histopathology slides of lymph node sections. The images have labels of "normal" (0) and "cancer" (1).

**Task:**  
Given an image, predict whether it is "normal" or "cancer".

**Methods Used:**

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Image resizing and normalization using `torchvision.transforms`.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - A custom CNN with multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activations, pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

- **Training:**
  - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (`nn.BCELoss`).
  - Optimizer: Adam (`torch.optim.Adam`).
  - Learning rate scheduler: StepLR.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Calculating AUROC using `sklearn.metrics`.
  - Saving the best model based on the lowest test loss and highest AUROC.

**Results:**  
Achieved an AUROC score of **0.87625**, ranking **5th out of 17** participants.

### 📈 Part 2: Regression Task

**Aim:**  
Design deep learning models to predict the breast cancer metastases ratio in digital histopathology images of lymph node sections.

**Objective:**  
Build a regression model to predict the metastasis ratio in images. The performance is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Dataset:**  
Consisting of images cropped from histopathology slides of lymph node sections. The percentages of metastases regions in images are provided.

**Task:**  
Given an image, predict the metastases ratio in the image.

**Methods Used:**

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Similar image preprocessing as in the classification task.
  - Handling of regression labels (`metastasis_ratio`).

- **Model Architecture:**
  - A modified CNN tailored for regression tasks, utilizing Mean Squared Error Loss (`nn.MSELoss`).

- **Training:**
  - Optimizer: Adam (`torch.optim.Adam`).
  - Learning rate scheduler: StepLR.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Calculating MAE and an additional L1 Loss for robustness.
  - Saving the best model based on the lowest test loss.

**Results:**  
Achieved an MAE score of **0.21155**, ranking **6th out of 15** participants.
